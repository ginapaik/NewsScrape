# NewsScrape

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

This app is not deployed to Heroku. You will need to clone the repository and access it locally.

Once cloned, open Git Bash from the folder on your local computer.

Run "node server.js"

Type the URL "localhost:8080" in your browser
